  Web for Moodle</b></p>
This extension enables the use of CopySafe Web in Moodle pages, 
				resulting in web pages safe from all copy including Print Screen 
				and screen capture. By adding a CopySafe Web encrypted image to 
				any web page will add protection for all content on that page 
				including normal images, text and video. So even if a small 20 x 
				20 pixel CopySafe image is added, when it loads it activates the 
				CopySafe Web browser plugin to control copy methods and prevent 
				screenshots. CopySafe Web is supported in popular web browsers across all Windows computers 
				since XP (92% of net users).<br>

                  <br>Normally, adding the code to use CopySafe Web on a pages 
				as complex and sophisticated as Moodle course resources can be 
				frustrating even for the most experienced web developer, but by 
				using this Moodle extension, inserting CopySafe Web protection 
				is now as simple as a clicking a button and ticking the 
				checkboxes for the options that you want to employ. From the 
				Moodle course editor you can add CopySafe Web images from the 
				TinyMice HTML editor by clicking the [C] button in the editor's 
				tool bar. The shortcode (placeholder) will then be inserted at 
				the current cursor position. Image size and protection settings 
				can be set as you select the image to use or at any time later 
				by simply editing parameters the in the shortcode. <br>
				<h3>
				How the Moodle CopySafe Extension Works</h3>
				When editing a page or post, click on the [C] icon above the HTML editor toolbar to insert the 
				&quot;shortcode&quot;, where the cursor was last placed in the text area. After uploading or selecting an existing image (from a previous upload), you can then nominate the security settings to use for the page or post. Different pages can use different security settings, for example, to allow the submission of web forms you may need to enable use of the keyboard.<br><br>

				<h3>Default Settings for this Moodle Extension</h3>
				Default settings can be applied to all CopySafe Web pages and 
				posts. Most useful for corporate networks and others who need to 
				limit access to certain types of web browsers, the default 
				settings page allows you to nominate which ones you want to 
				allow. Any browsers not qualifying will be redirected. You can 
				also select from 3 modes which can be changed at any time: <br>

  * While the CopySafe Web Moodle Extension is designed for use by CopySafe Web 
  software users, it will add a layer of protection for the page even in "demo" 
  mode. For example, in demo mode, you still have protection from right-mouse-click, 
  drag-and-drop and also control which web browsers can access the page. </p>
